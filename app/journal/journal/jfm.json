The flow has been extensively studied since the early 1990s as the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) occurring in the flow may explain the origin of the instability observed in some astrophysical objects. Elsewhere, the ideal approximation has been used to study high-speed flows, which sometimes produces paradoxical results. For example, ideal flows must be completely stabilised for a sufficiently strong applied magnetic field. On the other hand, the vanishing magnetic Prandtl number limit of the stability should be purely hydrodynamic, so instability must occur when Rayleigh\u2019s stability condition is violated. Our first discovery is that this apparent contradiction can be resolved by showing the abrupt appearance of the hydrodynamic instability at a certain critical value of the magnetic Prandtl number. This is found using the asymptotically large Reynolds number limit but with a sufficiently long wavelength to retain some diffusive effects. Our second finding concerns the so-called Velikhov\u2013Chandrasekhar paradox, namely the mismatch of the zero external magnetic field limit of the Velikhov\u2013Chandrasekhar stability criterion and Rayleigh\u2019s stability criterion.

The shallow-water equations capture these effects to first order only, resulting in a relatively simple two-dimensional fluid-dynamical model for the layer horizontal velocity and depth. The Green\u2013Naghdi equations, like the shallow-water equations, are two-dimensional fluid equations expressing momentum and mass conservation. There are different \u2018levels\u2019 of the Green\u2013Naghdi equations of rapidly increasing complexity. In the present paper we focus on the behaviour of the lowest-level Green\u2013Naghdi equations for a rotating shallow fluid layer, paying close attention to the flow structure at small spatial scales. We compare directly with the shallow-water equations and study the differences arising in their solutions. By recasting the equations into a form which both explicitly conserves Rossby\u2013Ertel potential vorticity and represents the leading-order departure from geostrophic\u2013hydrostatic balance, we are able to accurately describe both the \u2018slow\u2019 predominantly sub-inertial balanced dynamics and the \u2018fast\u2019 residual imbalanced dynamics.

Importantly, we find that this decomposition exposes a fundamental inconsistency in the Green\u2013Naghdi equations for horizontal scales less than the mean fluid depth, scales for which the Green\u2013Naghdi equations are supposed to more accurately model. Such scales exhibit pronounced activity compared to the shallow-water equations, and in particular spectra for certain fields like the divergence are flat or rising at high wavenumbers. This indicates a lack of convergence at small scales, and is also consistent with the poor convergence of total energy with resolution compared to the shallow-water equations. We suggest a mathematical reformulation of the Green\u2013Naghdi equations which may improve convergence at small scales."]},

In addition to primary streaks with the same wavelength as the blowing and suction, secondary streaks with half the wavelength also emerge in the 6 and 9\u00a0mm cases. The streaks develop into mushroom structures before breaking down. The breakdown processes of the three cases are dominated by a sinuous-mode instability, a varicose-mode instability and a combination of the two, respectively. Both fundamental and subharmonic instabilities are relevant in all cases. Multiple modes are identified in the secondary-instability stage, some of which originate from the primary instabilities (first and second Mack modes). We demonstrate that the first Mack mode can be destabilized to either a varicose-mode or sinuous-mode streak instability depending on its frequency and wavelength, whereas the second Mack mode undergoes a stabilizing stage before turning into a varicose mode in the 6 and 9\u00a0mm cases. An energy analysis reveals the stabilizing and destabilizing mechanisms of the primary instabilities under the influence of G\u00f6rtler vortices, highlighting the role played by the spanwise production based on the spanwise gradient of the streamwise velocity in both varicose and sinuous modes. The effects introduced by the secondary streaks are examined by filtering the secondary streaks in two new simulations with nominally identical conditions to those of the 6 and 9\u00a0mm cases. Remarkably, the secondary streaks can destabilize the G\u00f6rtler vortices, therefore advancing the transition.

Elsewhere, the ideal approximation has been used to study high-speed flows, which sometimes produces paradoxical results. For example, ideal flows must be completely stabilised for a sufficiently strong applied magnetic field. On the other hand, the vanishing magnetic Prandtl number limit of the stability should be purely hydrodynamic, so instability must occur when Rayleigh\u2019s stability condition is violated. Our first discovery is that this apparent contradiction can be resolved by showing the abrupt appearance of the hydrodynamic instability at a certain critical value of the magnetic Prandtl number. This is found using the asymptotically large Reynolds number limit but with a sufficiently long wavelength to retain some diffusive effects. Our second finding concerns the so-called Velikhov\u2013Chandrasekhar paradox, namely the mismatch of the zero external magnetic field limit of the Velikhov\u2013Chandrasekhar stability criterion and Rayleigh\u2019s stability criterion.

We compare directly with the shallow-water equations and study the differences arising in their solutions.

In addition to primary streaks with the same wavelength as the blowing and suction, secondary streaks with half the wavelength also emerge in the 6 and 9\u00a0mm cases.

Both fundamental and subharmonic instabilities are relevant in all cases. Multiple modes are identified in the secondary-instability stage, some of which originate from the primary instabilities (first and second Mack modes).

In addition to primary streaks with the same wavelength as the blowing and suction, secondary streaks with half the wavelength also emerge in the 6 and 9\u00a0mm cases.

The breakdown processes of the three cases are dominated by a sinuous-mode instability, a varicose-mode instability and a combination of the two, respectively. Both fundamental and subharmonic instabilities are relevant in all cases. Multiple modes are identified in the secondary-instability stage, some of which originate from the primary instabilities (first and second Mack modes).

By recasting the equations into a form which both explicitly conserves Rossby\u2013Ertel potential vorticity and represents the leading-order departure from geostrophic\u2013hydrostatic balance, we are able to accurately describe both the \u2018slow\u2019 predominantly sub-inertial balanced dynamics and the \u2018fast\u2019 residual imbalanced dynamics. This decomposition has proved fruitful in studies of shallow-water dynamics but appears not to have been used before in studies of Green\u2013Naghdi dynamics. Importantly, we find that this decomposition exposes a fundamental inconsistency in the Green\u2013Naghdi equations for horizontal scales less than the mean fluid depth, scales for which the Green\u2013Naghdi equations are supposed to more accurately model. Such scales exhibit pronounced activity compared to the shallow-water equations, and in particular spectra for certain fields like the divergence are flat or rising at high wavenumbers. This indicates a lack of convergence at small scales, and is also consistent with the poor convergence of total energy with resolution compared to the shallow-water equations. We suggest a mathematical reformulation of the Green\u2013Naghdi equations which may improve convergence at small scales."], "author": ["David G. Dritschel", "Mohammad Reza Jalali"]},

Multiple modes are identified in the secondary-instability stage, some of which originate from the primary instabilities (first and second Mack modes).

In addition to primary streaks with the same wavelength as the blowing and suction, secondary streaks with half the wavelength also emerge in the 6 and 9\u00a0mm cases. The streaks develop into mushroom structures before breaking down. The breakdown processes of the three cases are dominated by a sinuous-mode instability, a varicose-mode instability and a combination of the two, respectively. Both fundamental and subharmonic instabilities are relevant in all cases. Multiple modes are identified in the secondary-instability stage, some of which originate from the primary instabilities (first and second Mack modes). We demonstrate that the first Mack mode can be destabilized to either a varicose-mode or sinuous-mode streak instability depending on its frequency and wavelength, whereas the second Mack mode undergoes a stabilizing stage before turning into a varicose mode in the 6 and 9\u00a0mm cases.

Furthermore, the separated flow growth rate appears to decrease with downstream distance and the separation size is consistently smaller than the planar fin SBLI with the same inflow and fin configurations. The causes for the observed diminution of the separated flow and its downstream growth rate were investigated in the light of changes caused by the cylinder curvature on the inviscid as well as separation shock. It was found that the inviscid shock gets progressively weakened in the region close to the triple point with downstream distance due to the 3-D relief effect from cylinder curvature.

During the growth phase, an axisymmetric heap is formed, which grows either by periodic avalanches or by non-periodic avalanches that occur randomly over the azimuthal location of the heap, depending on the operating conditions and system properties. The dynamics of heap growth is characterized by the variation of the heap height, angle of repose and the angular velocity of the periodic avalanche with time, for different mass flow rates from the hopper.

To solve for the local linear and angular velocities that are coupled to the flagellar motion, we extend the method of regularized Brinkmanlets to incorporate a Kirchhoff rod, discretized as point forces and torques along a centreline. Representing a flagellum as a Kirchhoff rod, we investigate emergent waveforms for different preferred strain and twist functions. Since the Kirchhoff rod formulation allows for out-of-plane motion, in addition to studying a preferred planar sine wave configuration, we also study a preferred helical configuration. Our numerical method is validated by comparing results to asymptotic swimming speeds derived for an infinite-length cylinder propagating planar or helical waves. Similar to the asymptotic analysis for both planar and helical bending, we observe that with small amplitude bending, swimming speed is always enhanced relative to the case with no fibres in the fluid (Stokes) as the resistance parameter is increased. For regimes not accounted for with asymptotic analysis, i.e. large amplitude planar and helical bending, our model results show a non-monotonic change in swimming speed with respect to the resistance parameter; a maximum swimming speed is observed when the resistance parameter is near one. The non-monotonic behaviour is due to the emergent waveforms; as the resistance parameter increases, the swimmer becomes incapable of achieving the amplitude of its preferred configuration.

Second, beyond a critical Weissenberg number, the flow upstream becomes unsteady and switches between two bistable configurations, leading to symmetry breaking in the cylinder axis direction that is highly 3D in nature. Lastly, we find that the disturbance of the elastic instability propagates relatively far upstream via an elastic wave, and is weakly correlated with that in the cylinder wake. The wave speed and the extent of the instability increase with Weissenberg number, indicating an absolute instability in viscoelastic fluids."], "title": ["\nUpstream vortex and elastic wave in the viscoelastic flow around a confined cylinder\n"]},

Many previous studies have considered the CFL development in single, isolated vessels that are straight tubes or channels, as well as in isolated bifurcations and mergers. In the body, blood vessels are typically winding and sequentially bifurcate into smaller vessels or merge to form larger vessels. Because of this geometric complexity, the CFL ", " is three-dimensional (3D) and asymmetric, unlike in fully developed flow in straight tubes.

We show that the CFL significantly varies over different aspects of the networks. Along the vessel lengths, such variations are predominantly non-monotonic, which indicates that the CFL profiles do not simply become more symmetric over the length as they would in straight vessels. We show that vessel tortuosity causes the CFL to become more asymmetric along the length. We specifically identify a curvature-induced migration of the RBCs as the underlying mechanism of increased asymmetry in curved vessels. The vascular bifurcations and mergers are also seen to change the CFL profiles, and in the majority of them the CFL becomes more asymmetric. For most bifurcations, this is generally observed to occur such that the CFL downstream narrows on the side of the vessel nearest the upstream bifurcation, and widens on the other side. The 3D aspects of such behaviour are elucidated. For many bifurcations, a discrepancy exists between the CFL in the daughter vessels, which arises from a disproportionate partitioning between the flow rate and RBC flux. For most mergers, the downstream CFL narrows in the plane of the merger, but widens away from this plane. The dominant mechanism by which such changes occur is identified as the geometric focusing of the two merging streams.

On the other hand, an almost 80\u00a0% reduction in the root mean square value of the response oscillation is observed when the system is forced for a sufficiently large value of the frequency detuning (only for ", "). Such a reduction in amplitude occurs due to asynchronous quenching where resonant amplification of the forcing signal does not occur, as the frequency detuning is significantly high. Further, the results from a reduced-order model developed for a horizontal Rijke tube show a qualitative agreement with the dynamics observed in experiments. The relative phase between the acoustic pressure (", ") and the heat release rate (", ") oscillations in the model explains the occurrence of maximum reduction in the pressure amplitude due to asynchronous quenching.

Following the analysis of Cavalieri & Agarwal (", ", vol.\u00a0748, 2014. pp.\u00a0399\u2013415), we extend their methodology to model the acoustic sources of broadband shock-associated noise in imperfectly expanded supersonic jets using cross-spectral densities of the turbulent and shock-cell quantities. The aim is to determine the relationship between wavepacket coherence-decay and far-field broadband shock-associated noise, using the model as a vehicle to explore the flow mechanisms at work. Unlike the subsonic case where inclusion of coherence decay amplifies the sound pressure level over the whole acoustic spectrum, we find that it does not play such a critical role in determining the peak sound amplitude for shock-cell noise. When higher-order shock-cell modes are used to reconstruct the acoustic spectrum at higher frequencies, however, the inclusion of a jittering wavepacket is necessary. These results suggest that the requirement for coherence decay identified in prior broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) models is in reality the statistical signature of jittering wavepackets. The results from this modelling approach suggest that nonlinear jittering effects of wavepackets need to be included in dynamic models for broadband shock-associated noise."], "title": ["\nImpact of coherence decay on wavepacket models for broadband shock-associated noise in\u00a0supersonic jets\n"]},

Then we present a streaming-potential-based nanofluidic energy conversion system which comprises two immiscible fluids that form a flat interface in a slit-like channel. The validity of the Onsager reciprocal relation to such a two-fluid system is verified. The performance of such an energy converter is illustrated by considering two concrete oil\u2013water systems with different properties. In both cases, we predict that the binary system with a thin oil layer increases both the maximum output power and the energy conversion efficiency, and this enhancement depends strongly on the mobile charges present at the oil\u2013water interface, the salt concentration and the interface location. Concretely, for negatively charged interfaces, we find that the optimal efficiency increases with the interfacial charge for relatively thin oil layers; while for relatively thick oil layers, the interfacial charge has the opposite effect (i.e.\u00a0reduction effect) on the energy conversion efficiency in the ranges of the parameters. We further investigate these systems from the viewpoint of energy transfer by deriving the related energy equation. We find that viscous dissipation consumes most of the power (more than 90\u00a0%), in both single-phase and two-fluid flows. However, the ratio of the viscous dissipation to the power input decreases with increase of the interfacial charge density for the case of a relatively thin oil layer in two-fluid flows. Meanwhile, although the presence of interfacial charges can lead to an increase in electrical dissipation, the amount of the increased power consumption is less than that of the reduced viscous dissipation in the case of a thin oil layer. Therefore, for two-fluid energy converters, the total power consumption can be reduced and the efficiency is improved."], "title": ["\nElectrokinetic energy conversion of two-layer fluids through nanofluidic channels\n"]},

The phenomenon of sea ripple formation is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation in which the sediment bed is represented by a large number of fully resolved spherical grains (i.e. the flow around each individual particle is accounted for). Two sets of parameter values (differing in the amplitude and frequency of fluid oscillations, among other quantities) are adopted which are motivated by laboratory experiments on the formation of laminar rolling-grain ripples. The knowledge of the origin of ripples is presently enriched by insights and by providing fluid- and sediment-related quantities that are difficult to obtain in the laboratory (e.g. particle forces, statistics of particle motion, bed shear stress). In particular, detailed analysis of flow and sediment bed evolution has confirmed that ripple wavelength is determined by the action of steady recirculating cells which tend to accumulate sediment grains into ripple crests. The ripple amplitude is observed to grow exponentially, consistent with established linear stability analysis theories. Particles at the bed surface exhibit two kinds of motion depending on their position with respect to the recirculating cells: particles at ripple crests are significantly faster and show larger excursions than those lying in ripple troughs. In analogy with the segregation phenomenon of polydisperse sediments, the non-uniform distribution of the velocity field promotes the formation of ripples. The wider the gap between the excursion of fast and slow particles, the larger the resulting growth rate of the ripples. Finally, it is revealed that, in the absence of turbulence, the sediment flow rate is driven by both the bed shear stress and the wave-induced pressure gradient, the dominance of each depending on the phase of the oscillation period. In phases of maximum bed shear stress, the sediment flow rate correlates more with the Shields number while the pressure gradient tends to drive sediment bed motion during phases of minimum bed shear stress."], "title": ["\nDirect numerical simulations of ripples in an oscillatory flow\n"]},

The jets could be further distinguished as thin and thick jets, whose breakdown is found to be a function of the viscous force and surface tension, i.e. the Ohnesorge number. On the other hand, when the front is rough, the water film cannot rise up along the body surface, and instead early separation occurs to make the splash above a free surface. The splash size is quantified to assess the effects of the aspect ratio and impact speed. Upon splash formation, a cavity is created under the free surface, which emanates from the nose of the projectile. As the body sinks, the cavity pinch-off occurs due to the imbalance between the hydrostatic pressure and air pressure inside the cavity. At higher aspect ratios, cavity pinch-off occurs on the side wall of the projectile and leaves a portion of the cavity bubble on it. When the surface is smooth, no underwater cavity forms. Finally, we compare the hydrodynamic force acting on the sinking bodies with and without cavity formation, based on the underwater trajectory of each projectile.

For transverse bedforms, the experimental data validate the model at strong flows, providing evidence for the predicted geometric effect, but also for the increase of the wavelength close to the transport threshold.

The results show that the normalized overall mean velocity is an increasing function of the height to width ratio and a decreasing function of the sheath to sample viscosity ratio.

This interaction is described by a combination of direct numerical simulations and an asymptotic multiscale model. The multiscale theory is used to formulate explicit and dynamically consistent flux laws, which can be readily implemented in large-scale analytical and numerical models. Most previous theoretical investigations of thermohaline layering were based on the flux-gradient model, which assumes that the vertical transport of density components is uniquely determined by their local background gradients.

In addition to understanding and characterizing the particle dynamics, the study focused on illuminating the fluid flow field induced by the agglomerate in the presence of a background shear and the effect of collisions on this particle-induced flow. Perhaps the most interesting result of the current work was the observation that the flow field induced by a particle agglomerate rotating in a shear flow has the form of two tilted vortex rings with opposite-sign circulation. These rings are surrounded by a sea of stretched vorticity from the background shear flow. The agglomerate rotates in the shear flow, but at a slower rate than the ambient fluid elements. In the computations with two colliding agglomerates, we observed cases resulting in agglomerate merger, bouncing and fragmentation. However, the bouncing cases were all observed to also result in an exchange of particles between the two colliding agglomerates, so that they were influenced both by elastic rebound of the agglomerate structures as well as by tearing away of particulate matter between the agglomerates. Overall, the problems of agglomerate\u2013flow interaction and of the collision of two agglomerates in a shear flow are considerably richer in physical phenomena and more complex than can be described by the common approximation that represents each agglomerate by an \u2018equivalent sphere\u2019."], "title": ["\nCollision and breakup of fractal particle agglomerates in a shear flow\n"]},

A key attribute of atmospheric convection is the buoyancy source provided by the condensation of water vapour, but the presence of radiation, compressibility, liquid water and ice further complicate the system and our understanding of it. In this paper we present an idealized model of moist convection by taking the Boussinesq limit of the ideal-gas equations and adding a condensate that obeys a simplified Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation. The system allows moist convection to be explored at a fundamental level and reduces to the classical Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard\u00a0model if the latent heat of condensation is taken to be zero. The model has an exact, Rayleigh-number-independent \u2018drizzle\u2019 solution in which the diffusion of water vapour from a saturated lower surface is balanced by condensation, with the temperature field (and so the saturation value of the moisture) determined self-consistently by the heat released in the condensation.

We numerically determine the linear stability properties of this solution as a function of Rayleigh number and a non-dimensional latent-heat parameter.

Tests show two limiting behaviours with increasing particle inertia, similar to the results from previous linear stability analyses: low-inertia particles trigger the laminar-to-turbulent instability whereas high-inertia particles tend to stabilize turbulence due to the extra dissipation induced by particle\u2013fluid coupling. Furthermore, it is found that the streamwise coupling between phases is the dominant factor in damping of the turbulence and is highly related to the spatial distribution of the particles. The presence of particles in different turbulent coherent structures (large-scale vortices or large-scale streaks) determines the turbulent kinetic energy of particulate phase, which is related to the particle response time scaled by the turnover time of large-scale vortices. By quantitatively investigating the periodic character of the whole regeneration cycle and the phase difference between linked sub-steps, we show that the presence of inertial particles does not alter the periodic nature of the cycle or the relative length of each of the sub-steps. Instead, high-inertia particles greatly weaken the large-scale vortices as well as the streamwise vorticity stretching and lift-up effects, thereby suppressing the fluctuating amplitude of the large-scale streaks. The primary influence of low-inertia particles, however, is to strengthen the large-scale vortices, which fosters the cycle and ultimately reduces the critical Reynolds number."], "title": ["\nModulation of the turbulence regeneration cycle by inertial particles in planar Couette flow\n"]},

In both cases, the drag force coefficients of the particles are solved as functions of the separation distance between the particles and the permeability of the particles. The detailed flow field in the vicinity of the two particles is investigated by plotting the streamlines and velocity contours. We find that the particle\u2013particle interaction is dependent on the separation distance, particle sizes and permeability of the particles. Our analysis reveals that when the permeability of the particles is large, the streamlines are more parallel and the particle\u2013particle interaction has less effect on the particle motion.

The cell intensity and geometry are determined for several fluid-layer aspect ratios; the flow is shown to depend very weakly on Froude number (associated with surface deformation) or on Reynolds number if sufficiently large. The paper then focuses on the high Reynolds number regime for which the flow has become unsteady and three-dimensional while the surface is still almost flat.
