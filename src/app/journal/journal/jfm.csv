Here we show, by both experiments and theory, that when the liquid spreading takes place between a thin soap film and a glass fibre penetrating the film, the spreading is significantly slowed down. When the film thickness , becomes smaller than the fibre diameter ,, the strong hydrodynamic confinement effect of the soap film gives rise to a logarithmic relaxation with fibre creeping time ,. Such a slow dynamics of spreading is observed for hours both in the measured time-dependent height of capillary rise , on the fibre surface and viscous friction coefficient , felt by the glass fibre in contact with the soap film. A new theoretical approach based on the Onsager variational principle is developed to describe the dynamics of thin film spreading along a fibre. The newly derived equations of motion provide the analytical solutions of , and contact angle ,, which are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. Our work thus provides a common framework for understanding the confinement effect of thin soap films on the dynamics of spreading along a fibre.","

Ziskind","The present study deals with a theoretical investigation of a close-contact melting (CCM) process involving a vertical cylinder on a horizontal isothermal surface, where the liquid phase is a non-Newtonian viscoplastic fluid that behaves according to the Bingham model. Accordingly, a new approach is formulated based on the thin layer approximation and different quasi-steady process assumptions. By analytical derivation, an algebraic equation that relates the molten layer thickness and the solid bulk height is developed. The problem is then solved numerically, coupled with another equation for the melting rate. The new model shows that as the yield stress increases the melting rate decreases and the molten layer thickness increases. It is found that under certain conditions, the model can be reduced to a form that allows an analytical solution. The approximate model predicts an exponential dependence of both the melt fraction and the molten layer thickness. Comparison between the numerical and analytical solutions shows that the analytical approximation provides an excellent estimation for sufficiently large values of the yield stress. Dimensional analysis, which is supported by the analytical model results, reveals the dimensionless groups that govern the problem. For the general case, the melt fraction is a function of two dimensionless groups. For the analytical approximation, it is shown that the melt fraction is governed by a single dimensionless group and that the molten layer thickness is governed by two dimensionless groups.","

Law","The role of a transversal concentration gradient in detonation propagation in a two-dimensional channel filled with an , mixture is examined by high-resolution simulation. Results show that, compared to propagation in homogeneous media, a concentration gradient reduces the average detonation velocity because of the delay in reaching downstream reaction equilibrium, leading to a large amount of unreacted , and hence significant species fluctuations. The transversal concentration gradient also enhances the cellular detonation instability. Steepening it reduces considerably the number of triple points on the front, lengthens the global detonation front structure on average and consequently increases the deficit of the average detonation velocity. It is further found that the interaction of the leading shock with the transversal concentration gradient influences the formation of local , bump and thus the unreacted pocket behind the front, while the transverse wave causes mixing and burning of the residue fuel downstream. Nevertheless, for the steepened concentration gradient, a transverse detonation is present and consumes the fuel in the compressed and preheated zone by the leading shock; consequently, the detonation velocity deficit is not increased significantly for detonation with the single-head propagation mode close to the limit.","

With a heated isothermal wall, the wall temperature sets such that the flow temperature varies through the pseudo-critical temperature, and thus pseudo-boiling phenomena occur within the boundary layers. The pseudo-boiling process induces strongly nonlinear real-fluid effects in the flow and interacts with near-wall turbulence. The peculiar abrupt density variations through the pseudo-boiling process induce significant near-wall density fluctuations , within the heated transcritical turbulent boundary layers. The large near-wall density fluctuations induce a turbulent mass flux ,, and the turbulent mass flux amplifies the Favre-averaged velocity fluctuations , in the near-wall predominant structures of streamwise low-speed streaks that are associated with the ejection (where , and ,), while reducing the velocity fluctuations in the high-speed streaks associated with the sweep (, and ,). Although the near-wall low-speed and high-speed streak structures dominate the Reynolds-shear-stress generation, the energized Favre-averaged velocity fluctuations in the low-speed streaks enhance both the mean-density- and density-fluctuation-related Reynolds shear stresses (, and ,) in the ejection event and, as a result, alter the Reynolds-shear-stress profile. The large density fluctuations also alter the near-wall viscous-stress profile and induce a near-wall convective flux , (due to non-zero ,). The changes in the contributions in the stress-balance equation result in a failure of existing velocity transformations to collapse to the universal law of the wall. The large density fluctuations also greatly contribute to the turbulent kinetic energy budget, and especially the mass flux contribution term becomes noticeable as one of the main positive terms. The unheated non-transcritical turbulent boundary layers show a negligible contribution of the real-fluid effects, and the turbulence statistics agree well with the statistics of an incompressible constant-property turbulent boundary layer with a perfect-gas law.","

Kuerten,Luca Ridolfi","A temporal complex network-based approach is proposed as a novel formulation to investigate turbulent mixing from a Lagrangian viewpoint. By exploiting a spatial proximity criterion, the dynamics of a set of fluid particles is geometrized into a time-varying weighted network. Specifically, a numerically solved turbulent channel flow is employed as an exemplifying case. We show that the time-varying network is able to clearly describe the particle swarm dynamics, in a parametrically robust and computationally inexpensive way. The network formalism enables us to straightforwardly identify transient and long-term flow regimes, the interplay between turbulent mixing and mean flow advection and the occurrence of proximity events among particles. Thanks to their versatility and ability to highlight significant flow features, complex networks represent a suitable tool for Lagrangian investigations of turbulent mixing. The present application of complex networks offers a powerful resource for Lagrangian analysis of turbulent flows, thus providing a further step in building bridges between turbulence research and network science.","

Le Dizès","New solutions describing the interaction of helical pairs of counter-rotating vortices are obtained using a vortex filament approach. The vortices are assumed to have a small core size allowing the calculation of the self-induced velocities from the Biot–Savart law using the cutoff theory. These new vortex structures do not possess any helical symmetry but they exhibit a spatial periodicity and are stationary in a rotating and translating frame. Their properties, such as radial deformation, frame velocity and induced flow, are provided as a function of the four geometric parameters characterizing each solution. Approximate solutions are also obtained when the mutual interaction is weak. This allows us to provide explicit expressions for the rotation and translation velocities of the structure in this limit. First-order corrections describing helix deformation are also calculated and used for comparison with the numerical results. The variation of the vortex core size induced by the helix deformation is also analysed. We show that these variations have a weak effect on the shape and characteristics of the solutions, for the range of parameters that we have considered. The results are finally applied to rotor wakes. It is explained how these solutions could possibly describe the far wake of an helicopter rotor in vertical flight.","

It is shown that, in a two-dimensional simulation of the Kármán vortex street at moderate Reynolds number (,), our artificial neural network is able to learn an active control strategy from experimenting with the mass flow rates of two jets on the sides of a cylinder. By interacting with the unsteady wake, the artificial neural network successfully stabilizes the vortex alley and reduces drag by approximately 8 %. This is performed while using small mass flow rates for the actuation, of the order of 0.5 % of the mass flow rate intersecting the cylinder cross-section once a new pseudo-periodic shedding regime is found. This opens the way to a new class of methods for performing active flow control.","

" 20 February 2019, 25 April 2019",Kengo Deguchi,"The large Reynolds number asymptotic approximations of the neutral curve of Taylor–Couette flow subject to an axial uniform magnetic field are analysed. The flow has been extensively studied since the early 1990s as the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) occurring in the flow may explain the origin of the instability observed in some astrophysical objects. Elsewhere, the ideal approximation has been used to study high-speed flows, which sometimes produces paradoxical results. For example, ideal flows must be completely stabilised for a sufficiently strong applied magnetic field. On the other hand, the vanishing magnetic Prandtl number limit of the stability should be purely hydrodynamic, so instability must occur when Rayleigh’s stability condition is violated. Our first discovery is that this apparent contradiction can be resolved by showing the abrupt appearance of the hydrodynamic instability at a certain critical value of the magnetic Prandtl number. This is found using the asymptotically large Reynolds number limit but with a sufficiently long wavelength to retain some diffusive effects. Our second finding concerns the so-called Velikhov–Chandrasekhar paradox, namely the mismatch of the zero external magnetic field limit of the Velikhov–Chandrasekhar stability criterion and Rayleigh’s stability criterion. We show for fully wide-gap cases that the high Reynolds number asymptotic analysis of the MRI naturally yields the simple stability condition that describes smooth transition from Rayleigh to Velikhov–Chandrasekhar stability criteria with increasing Lundquist number.","

Stone","Classical diffusiophoresis describes the motion of particles in an electrolyte or non-electrolyte solution with an imposed concentration gradient. We investigate the autophoresis of two particles in an electrolyte solution where the concentration gradient is produced by either adsorption or desorption of ions at the particle surfaces. We find that when the sorption fluxes are large, the ion concentration near the particle surfaces, and consequently the Debye length, is strongly modified, resulting in a nonlinear dependence of the phoretic speed on the sorption flux. In particular, we show that the phoretic velocity saturates at a finite value for large desorption fluxes, but depends superlinearly on the flux for adsorption fluxes, where both conclusions are in contrast with previous results that predict a linear relationship between autophoretic velocity and sorption flux. Our theory can also be applied to precipitation/dissolution and other surface chemical processes.","

" 20 February 2019, 25 April 2019","Thibault Vieu,Innocent Mutabazi","We formulate the Oldroyd-B model for viscoelastic fluids in terms of magnetic-like fields obeying a set of equations analogous to Maxwell’s equations. In the limit of infinite relaxation time for the polymer, the polymeric stress tensor can be identified with the Maxwell stress tensor of a magnetic field. Away from this asymptotic case, the stress tensor of the polymer cannot be decomposed in terms of a tensor product of a magnetic field any more and several theoretical issues arise. We show that the analogy between the Oldroyd-B model and Maxwell’s equations can still be rigorously extended provided that one defines three magnetic-like fields obeying Maxwell’s equations with magnetic currents and charges. This solves the theoretical caveats and leads to a better understanding of the viscoelastic instability. In particular, we evidence a gauge symmetry which unifies some previous works, and we investigate several gauge choices. As an illustration we apply our method to viscoelastic Taylor–Couette flow but this theory of ‘viscoelastic fields’ is general and may be useful in a large variety of viscoelastic flows. The present study may also be of interest from the electromagnetic point of view, as it provides real systems possessing magnetic-like charges (monopoles) and currents.","

" 19 February 2019, 25 April 2019","David G. Dritschel,Mohammad Reza Jalali","The Green–Naghdi equations are an extension of the shallow-water equations that capture the effects of finite fluid depth at arbitrary order in the characteristic height to width aspect ratio ,. The shallow-water equations capture these effects to first order only, resulting in a relatively simple two-dimensional fluid-dynamical model for the layer horizontal velocity and depth. The Green–Naghdi equations, like the shallow-water equations, are two-dimensional fluid equations expressing momentum and mass conservation. There are different ‘levels’ of the Green–Naghdi equations of rapidly increasing complexity. In the present paper we focus on the behaviour of the lowest-level Green–Naghdi equations for a rotating shallow fluid layer, paying close attention to the flow structure at small spatial scales. We compare directly with the shallow-water equations and study the differences arising in their solutions. By recasting the equations into a form which both explicitly conserves Rossby–Ertel potential vorticity and represents the leading-order departure from geostrophic–hydrostatic balance, we are able to accurately describe both the ‘slow’ predominantly sub-inertial balanced dynamics and the ‘fast’ residual imbalanced dynamics. This decomposition has proved fruitful in studies of shallow-water dynamics but appears not to have been used before in studies of Green–Naghdi dynamics. Importantly, we find that this decomposition exposes a fundamental inconsistency in the Green–Naghdi equations for horizontal scales less than the mean fluid depth, scales for which the Green–Naghdi equations are supposed to more accurately model. Such scales exhibit pronounced activity compared to the shallow-water equations, and in particular spectra for certain fields like the divergence are flat or rising at high wavenumbers. This indicates a lack of convergence at small scales, and is also consistent with the poor convergence of total energy with resolution compared to the shallow-water equations. We suggest a mathematical reformulation of the Green–Naghdi equations which may improve convergence at small scales.","

" 19 February 2019, 25 April 2019","H. V. Moradi,J. M. Floryan","The primary and secondary laminar flows in annuli with longitudinal grooves and driven by pressure gradients have been analysed. There exist geometric configurations reducing pressure losses in primary flows in spite of an increase of the wall wetted area. The parameter ranges when such flows exist have been determined using linear stability theory. Two types of secondary flows have been identified. The first type has the form of the classical travelling waves driven by shear and modified by the grooves. The axisymmetric waves dominate for sufficiently large radii of the annuli while different spiral waves dominate for small radii. The secondary flow topology is unique in the former case and has the form of axisymmetric rings propagating in the axial direction. Topologies in the latter case are not unique, as spiral waves with left and right twists can emerge under the same conditions, resulting in flow structures varying from spatial rings to rhombic forms. The most intense motion of this type occurs near the walls. The second type of secondary flow has the form of travelling waves driven by inertial effects with characteristics very distinct from the shear waves. Its critical Reynolds number increases proportionally to ,, where , denotes the groove amplitude, while the amplification rates increase proportionally to ,. These waves exist only if , is above a well-defined minimum and their axisymmetric forms dominate, with the most intense motion occurring near the annulus mid-section. Geometries that give preference to the latter waves have been identified. It is shown that the drag-reducing topographies stabilize the classical travelling waves; these waves are driven by viscous shear, so reduction of this shear decreases their amplification. The same topographies destabilize the new waves; these waves are driven by an inviscid mechanism associated with the formation of circumferential inflection points, and an increase of the groove amplitude increases their amplification. The flow conditions when the presence of grooves can be ignored, i.e. the annuli can be treated as being hydraulically smooth, have been determined.","

The ferrofluid coats a copper wire, through which an electric current is run. The induced azimuthal magnetic field magnetises the ferrofluid, which in turn stabilises the well known Plateau–Rayleigh instability seen in axisymmetric capillary jets. This model is of interest because the stabilising mechanism allows for axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamical solitary waves. A numerical scheme capable of computing steady periodic, solitary and generalised solitary wave solutions is presented. It is found that the solution space for the model is very similar to that of the classical problem of two-dimensional gravity–capillary waves.","

Zaki","This work demonstrates that the popular arithmetic mean conformation tensor frequently used in the analysis of turbulent viscoelastic flows is not a good representative of the ensemble. Alternative means based on recent developments in the literature are proposed, namely, the geometric and log-Euclidean means. These means are mathematically consistent with the Riemannian structure of the manifold of positive-definite tensors, on which the conformation tensor lives, and have useful properties that make them attractive alternatives to the arithmetic mean. Using a turbulent FENE-P channel flow dataset, it is shown that these two alternatives are physically representative of the ensemble. By definition, these means minimize the geodesic distance to realizations and exactly preserve the scalar geometric mean of the volume and of the principal stretches. The proposed geometric and log-Euclidean means have clear physical interpretations and are attractive quantities for turbulence modelling.","

To this end, we develop a simplified model based on the Lagrangian formalism assuming a pulsating bubble with a spherical shape. Moreover, to account for the effects of a deformable bubble, we also perform detailed two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations. Qualitative agreement is found between the simplified approach and the detailed numerical simulations. Our results reveal that the acoustic excitation enhances the mobility of the bubble, by increasing the size of the yielded region that surrounds the bubble, thereby decreasing the effective viscosity of the liquid and accelerating the motion of the bubble. This effect is significantly more pronounced at the resonance frequency, and it is shown that bubble motion takes place even for Bingham numbers (,) that can be orders of magnitude higher than the critical , for bubble entrapment in the case of a static pressure field.","

Lee","This study investigates the stability and transition of Görtler vortices in a hypersonic boundary layer using linear stability theory and direct numerical simulations. In the simulations, Görtler vortices are separately excited by wall blowing and suction with spanwise wavelengths of 3, 6 and 9 mm. In addition to primary streaks with the same wavelength as the blowing and suction, secondary streaks with half the wavelength also emerge in the 6 and 9 mm cases. The streaks develop into mushroom structures before breaking down. The breakdown processes of the three cases are dominated by a sinuous-mode instability, a varicose-mode instability and a combination of the two, respectively. Both fundamental and subharmonic instabilities are relevant in all cases. Multiple modes are identified in the secondary-instability stage, some of which originate from the primary instabilities (first and second Mack modes). We demonstrate that the first Mack mode can be destabilized to either a varicose-mode or sinuous-mode streak instability depending on its frequency and wavelength, whereas the second Mack mode undergoes a stabilizing stage before turning into a varicose mode in the 6 and 9 mm cases. An energy analysis reveals the stabilizing and destabilizing mechanisms of the primary instabilities under the influence of Görtler vortices, highlighting the role played by the spanwise production based on the spanwise gradient of the streamwise velocity in both varicose and sinuous modes. The effects introduced by the secondary streaks are examined by filtering the secondary streaks in two new simulations with nominally identical conditions to those of the 6 and 9 mm cases. Remarkably, the secondary streaks can destabilize the Görtler vortices, therefore advancing the transition. The stability theory results are in good agreement with those from direct numerical simulations.","

Experiments uncover distinctive instability regimes with an increase in electric field Rayleigh number (,) – a linear-onset regime, a time-periodic nonlinear regime analogous to the von Kármán vortex street in the downstream and a regime with coherent flow patterns. The experiments also reveal that such linear and nonlinear instabilities can be stimulated non-invasively in a microchannel to mix or de-mix fluids simply by turning the electric field on or off, indicating the suitability of the process for on-demand micromixing. The characteristics of these instabilities have been theoretically investigated with the help of an Orr–Sommerfeld framework, which discloses the possibility of five distinctive finite-wavenumber modes for the instability. The EHD stresses originating due to the application of electric field stimulate a pair of shorter-wavelength electric field modes beyond a critical value of ,. Increase in the levels of charge injection and EHD stresses lower the critical , of these modes. The relatively longer-wavelength viscous mode is found to appear when the viscosity stratification between the fluid layers is high. Beyond a threshold Schmidt number (,), a diffusive mode is also found to appear near the mixed interfacial region. A thinner interface between the fluids at a higher , helps this mode to behave as the interfacial mode of immiscible fluids. Contrast of ionic mobility in the fluids leads to the appearance of the K-mode of instability at much shorter wavelengths. The reported phenomena can be of significance in the domains of microscale mixing, pumping, heat exchange, mass transfer and reaction engineering.","

Ayton,Paruchuri Chaitanya","This paper presents an analytic solution for gust–aerofoil interaction noise for flat plates with spanwise-varying periodic leading edges in uniform mean flow. The solution is obtained by solving the linear inviscid equations via separation of variables and the Wiener–Hopf technique, and is suitable for calculating the far-field noise generated by any leading edge with a single-valued piecewise linear periodic spanwise geometry. Acoustic results for homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow are calculated by integrating the single-gust solution over a wavenumber spectrum. The far-sound pressure level is calculated for five test-case geometries; sawtooth serration, slitted ,-root, slitted ,-root, chopped peak and square wave, and compared to experimental measurements. Good agreement is seen over a range of frequencies and tip-to-root ratios (varying the sharpness of the serration). The analytic solution is then used to calculate the propagating pressure along the leading edge of the serration for fixed spanwise wavenumbers, i.e. only the contribution to the surface pressure which propagates to the far field. Using these results, two primary mechanisms for noise reduction are discussed; tip and root interference, and a redistribution of energy from cuton modes to cutoff modes. A secondary noise-reduction mechanism due to nonlinear features is also discussed and seen to be particularly important for leading edges with very narrow slits.","

This fin-on-cylinder SBLI unit has several unique features caused by the three-dimensional (3-D) relief offered by the cylindrical surface that noticeably alter the shock structure. Complementary experimental and computational studies are made to delineate both the surface and off-body flow features of the fin-on-cylinder SBLI unit and to obtain a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that dictate the mean flow and wall pressure features of the SBLI unit. Results show that the fin-on-cylinder SBLI exhibits substantial deviation from quasi-conical symmetry that is observed in planar fin SBLI. Furthermore, the separated flow growth rate appears to decrease with downstream distance and the separation size is consistently smaller than the planar fin SBLI with the same inflow and fin configurations. The causes for the observed diminution of the separated flow and its downstream growth rate were investigated in the light of changes caused by the cylinder curvature on the inviscid as well as separation shock. It was found that the inviscid shock gets progressively weakened in the region close to the triple point with downstream distance due to the 3-D relief effect from cylinder curvature. This weakening of the inviscid shock feeds into the separation shock, which is also independently impacted by the 3-D relief, to result in the observed modifications in the fin-on-cylinder SBLI unit.","
